# Core Concepts & Terms

* Mana is the number of IKZ cards that are necessary to summon or utilize it.
* Health is how many points it takes to take the card out.
* Attack is the number of health points it can deduct from another card.
* Gate points are the number of points that interact with the gate's ability when utilizing the gate to bring and entity from the alley section of the board to the garden.
* Cards can be in an untapped or tapped state depending on if they're just placed or if they've attacked.
* Weapons are equips that can be added to an entity to boost their attack. But also sometimes weapons have effects that affect the game.
* Spells are one time use cards that have some effect on the game. Spell cards that are response can be played when it is not the player's turn in response to something like an attack.
* Gates are a single card that each deck has that is use to bring entities from the alley to the garden. When using a gate they have effects that are affected by the entities gate points
* A leader is a single card that each deck has that is always in the game. Leaders can attack. When a leader loses all its health points the game is over. The leader has effects that can alter the game somehow.
* IKZ cards are basically mana.

Each starter deck seems to have 17 cards (minus the IKZ cards), but they have duplicates to add up to 63 cards per deck.

# The field

The field is where cards are placed:
1. The garden is the front row. This is where entities battle. Your leader is always in the garden.
2. The alley is the back row. Entities cannot battle or be targeted by the attacks here. Your gate can portal entities from the alley into the garde.
3. The IKZ pile is where IKZ cards are placed face-down. Each turn, draw 1 IKZ cards to pay for the card cost.
4. The IKZ area is where IKZ cards are placed. Tap the IKZ cards to pay for the card cost.
5. Your 50-card deck goes in the deck area.
6. Cards that exit the field or are discarded are placed in the discard pile face-up.

# Your deck

Each player will need a 50-card deck, 1 leader card, 1 gate card, 10 IKZ cards, and 1 IKZ token card.

## Setting up

1. place your leader card and gate card in their designated areas face-up
2. shuffle your 50 card deck.
3. Put your deck in the deck area face down
4. put your ikz cards in the ikz deck area
5. Use method, such as rolling the die to determine who goes first
6. Draw 7 cards from the top of your deck (you may mulligan once if you choose)
7. The first player beings the game

### Mulligan

If you are unsatisfied with your starting hand, you may choose to mulligan once. When doing so, return your hand to the bottom of your deck, then draw 7 new cards. Shuffle your deck when finished.

# Winning the game

- You win the game by bringing your opponent's leader down to 0 health
- decking out: alternatively, if your opponent attempts to draw a card from their deck when no cards are left in it.

# Understanding the cards

1. Leader: the main character that defines your deck and represents your health total
2. Gate: The core of your deck with unique portal abilities, guiding strategy and play style
3. Entity: Your leader's allies are called entities. They are place in the field when played and can attack when they are in the garden.
4. Weapon: Cards used to empower your entity and leader cards. They are placed in the discard pile at the end of the turn.
5. Spell: cards that provide powerful one-time effects. These are placed in the discard pile after their effects resolve.
6. IKZ: Resource card used to pay for the card cost.

# Playing the cards

Each card has an IKZ cost. To play the card, you must tap that many IKZ cards in your IKZ area. Once a card is played, the tapped IKZ cards remain tapped until the beginning of your next turn.

# Using Cards

To attack with a card or use abilities that have a tap requirement, turn the card sideways to indicate that it is attacking or its ability is activated.
Card abilities without a tap requirement do not need to be tapped to activate. Once tapped, cards will remain tapped until the beginning of your next turn.

## Cooldown

Entity cards cannot attack or activate abilities that require them to be tapped on the turn they enter the garden.

# Combat

Combat is broken into 3 main phases.

1. Active player declares attack.
   - Tap an untapped leader or entity card to declare it as the attacker. Then choose a leader or tapped entity as the target.
   - You may activate "when attacking" effects if the attacking card has such an ability.
2. Defending player can react by taking the below actions in this order (skipping any action is not applicable).
   a. You may activate "response" effect cards on the field or play "response" cards from your hand (by paying IKZ cost).
   b. You may tap an untapped "Defender" card to make it become the new attack target.
   c. You may activate any "when attacking" effects of the leader or entity being attacked.
3. Combat resolution. Damage resolves with 2 cards dealing damage equal to their attack to each other's health simultaneously. If an entity's health reaches 0, it is destroyed and goes to the discard pile. If your leader's health is reduced to 0 you lose the game. The active player must activate any "after attacking" effects.

# player actions

Here are some common player actions and frequently seen rule text.
- Sacrifice: a player-initiated action that places a card from play into the discard pile, usually to pay a cost or fulfill a condition. Sacrificed cards are not considered destroyed.
- Bottom deck: Place one or more cards at the bottom of your deck (additional rule text may follow to determine the order they are placed).

# Activating abilities

Abilities on cards often have activation requirements or a cost. Usually it is formatted as `Cost of Activation : Resulting effect`
If you do not pay the cost of activation, then you cannot activate the resulting effect after the colon. If you pay the cost of activation then you MUST resolve the resulting effect (unless the rule text says "may", then you can choose otherwise).

# Phases of player turns

Combat is broken into 3 phases

## 1. Start of turn phase

The start of turn phase is the first phase of a turn. It involves a few actions that prepare the player for main phase. The following events occur during this phase in order.
1. Untap cards: untap all cards on the field, including your leader your gate, entities, and IKZ cards.
2. Activate "start of turn" effects: you may activate effects and abilities from cards that are in play.
3. Draw cards: draw 1 cards from your deck (if there are no cards left in your deck you lose the game)
4. Gain IKZ: draw 1 card from your IKZ pile and place it in your IKZ area face-up. If no IKZ cards remain, then draw no IKZ card.
Note: On their first turn, the player going 2nd also places the IKZ token card into their IKZ area face-up. Like IKZ cards, the IKZ token card can be tapped to pay for card costs. It is placed outside of the game beside the discard pile after is is used to pay for the cost. It cannot be used again.

## 2. Main phase

The main phase is the second phase in a turn when the majority of the actions are taken place by the active player. The following actions can be taken during this phase in any order.
- Play cards: you may play any number of cards from your hand, as long as your are able to pay for their IKZ cost. Most card types can be played during the main phase, except for "response" cards, which can only be played when the opponent declares an attack.
- Attack: leader (when equipped with a weapon) and entites in the garden can attack. You may attack as many times as you wish as long as you are able to, declaring and resolving 1 attack at a time.
- Activate card effects and abilities: cards in play may have a number of different abilities and effects that can be activated. Make sure to follow the card rules for any activation requirements such as "tap", "main", "once/turn", etc.

## 3. End of turn phase

The end of turn phase is the last phase in a turn when certain end of turn effects and abilities may resolve. The following events can happen during this phase in order.
1. Activate end of turn effects: If cards in play have any "end of turn" effects, you may activate them in any order, resolving them one at a time.
2. Reset entity health: if any entity in play was dealt damage this turn, it's health is reset.
3. Activate end during-based effects: Any effects or conditions on your leader or entities with a specified duration such as "until end of turn" expire.
4. Un-equip weapon cards: if any weapon cards are in play, they must be placed in the discard pile.

When ready, the active player declares the end-of-turn, passing play to their opponent.

### Turn Phase Breakdown

#### Start of Turn Phase (Automatic with optional player choices)
- **Requires user input**: Optional; decisions are only needed when multiple start-of-turn effects need ordering or when the player can decline optional effects.
- **Guaranteed actions**: Untap all cards in play (cards with `shocked` stay tapped), draw 1 card from the deck (a deck-out loss replaces the draw if no cards remain), and attempt to draw 1 IKZ card (skip only when the IKZ pile is empty).
- **Conditional actions**: Resolve "start of turn" abilities printed on cards (follow each card's optional/mandatory text) and, on the second player's first turn, move the IKZ token into the IKZ area and exile it after use.

#### Main Phase (Player-directed)
- **Requires user input**: Yes; the active player must choose which actions to take and when to end the phase.
- **Guaranteed actions**: None; the game waits for the active player to act until they end the turn.
- **Conditional actions**: Play cards by paying IKZ costs, declare attacks one at a time with eligible leaders or entities, and activate abilities whose conditions are met (respecting tags such as `main`, `tap`, or `once/turn`).

#### End of Turn Phase (Automatic with optional cleanup choices)
- **Requires user input**: Optional; only needed to order simultaneous end-of-turn triggers or to acknowledge optional text.
- **Guaranteed actions**: Check each entity for damage and reset its health, expire "until end of turn" style durations, and move any equipped weapons to the discard pile.
- **Conditional actions**: Resolve "end of turn" abilities and other lingering effects that reference the phase; players choose the order if multiple abilities are pending.

### Combat Phase Breakdown

#### Attack Declaration (Active player)
- **Requires user input**: Yes; the active player selects an untapped attacker and a legal target before combat proceeds.
- **Guaranteed actions**: Tap the chosen attacker and lock in its target before opening the response window.
- **Conditional actions**: Trigger any "when attacking" effects on the attacker; these may require the player to make choices or resolve mandatory text.

#### Defender Response Window (Defending player)
- **Requires user input**: Optional; the defending player may respond but can also pass priority.
- **Guaranteed actions**: Present the defending player with a window to respond before damage resolves.
- **Conditional actions**: Play "response" spells or abilities by paying their IKZ costs, tap an untapped entity with `defender` to redirect the attack, and activate any effects that can fire during this window (such as text on the card being attacked).

#### Combat Resolution (Automatic)
- **Requires user input**: No; damage resolution proceeds automatically once both players pass.
- **Guaranteed actions**: Deal simultaneous damage between attacker and target, send destroyed entities to the discard pile, and check for leader lethal to end the game if applicable.
- **Conditional actions**: Resolve "after attacking" or "when attacked" effects that trigger from the outcome; individual card text determines whether the controller must make decisions.
